## Methods with example and description


#### startUpload
Initiates an upload and returns a storage link that is valid for 30 minutes. You can use the storage link to make subsequent upload request with file buffer or blob.




```swift
applicationClient.filestorage.startUpload(namespace: namespace, body: body) { (response, error) in
    // Use response
}
```





| Argument | Type | Required | Description |
| -------- | ---- | -------- | ----------- | 
| namespace | String | yes | Segregation of different types of files(products, orders, logistics etc), Required for validating the data of the file being uploaded, decides where exactly the file will be stored inside the storage bucket. |  
| body | StartRequest | yes | Request body |


Use this API to perform the first step of uploading (i.e. **Start**) an arbitrarily sized buffer or blob.

The three major steps are:
* Start
* Upload
* Complete

### Start
Initiates the assets upload using `startUpload`.
It returns a storage link in response.

### Upload
Use the storage link to upload a file (Buffer or Blob) to the File Storage.
Make a `PUT` request on storage link received from `startUpload` API with the file (Buffer or Blob) in the request body.

### Complete
After successfully upload, call the `completeUpload` API to finish the upload process.
This operation will return the URL of the uploaded file.


*Returned Response:*




[StartResponse](#StartResponse)

Success. Next, call the `completeUpload` API and pass the response payload of this API to finish the upload process.
